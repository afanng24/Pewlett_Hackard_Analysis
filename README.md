# A Written Report for the Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of Pewlett Hackard Analysis
The objective of PyBer_Challange is to create more csv files from the csv files inside the data folder to give a clearer picture of the number of retiring employees per title, as well as employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. The outcome of the challenge is three new csv files in the data folder named retirement_titles.csv, unique_titles.csv, and retiring_titles.csv. The outcome of those csv files is then used to create the second part of the objective which is to find eligible employees who can take part in the mentorship program. The data then is imported into a fourth and final csv named mentorship_eligibilty.csv in the data folder.
